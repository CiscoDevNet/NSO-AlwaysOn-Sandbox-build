# Script to load NSO Container Image into Docker
# This script loads the NSO container image from a tar.gz file and verifies 
# that the loaded image matches the expected BASE_IMAGE and NSO_VERSION
# 
# Search order for the container image file:
# 1. Project root directory
# 2. NSO_CONTAINER_IMAGE_PATH (if set in sandbox_env_vars.sh)
# 3. Home directory (default fallback)
#
# Note: This script handles differences between Docker and Podman image naming:
# - Docker: uses short names (e.g., cisco-nso-prod)
# - Podman: expands to full registry paths (e.g., docker.io/library/cisco-nso-prod)
